## A description of the problem and a discussion of the background

I will try to sugest the best place for the restaurant in Zagreb. Zagreb is the capitol of the Croatia and Croatia is one small country in the European Union. Zagreb is the biggest town in the Croatia and it has almost 800 thousands people. Zagreb is devided in 17 parts and whole town area has 641 square kilometers. Some parts are residential and some parts are more industrial. I hope that type of these parts will be obvious.
